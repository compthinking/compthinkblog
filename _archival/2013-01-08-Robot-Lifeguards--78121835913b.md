Hereâ€™s some interesting research on a Neural Network approach to [teaching a machine to detect when someone is drowning](http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg21728985.700-ai-lifeguard-could-save-young-swimmers-from-drowning.html). This could lead to better detection of people in need of help or dispatch and guidance for robotic lifeguards.
