This is exactly the kind of thing we need more of not less of. The only way to help us understand the climate so that we can make predictions about what will happen under different policies is to have experimental areas like the ELA. It’s strange that the people who want everyone to calm down about climate change because they think there isn’t enough data to draw conclusions are shutting down organizations and experimental facilities like this that could actually help improve our already very strong understanding of how our climate is changing.
