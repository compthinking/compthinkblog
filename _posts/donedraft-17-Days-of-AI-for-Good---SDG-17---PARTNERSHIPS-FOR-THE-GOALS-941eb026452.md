ITU is working with other United Nations agen­cies, and the XPRIZE Foundation, to organize the “AI for Good Global Summit”… The summit will bring together governments, industry, academia and civil society to explore the responsible development of human-centric AI in solving humanity’s grand challenges, including accelerating the all-important SDGs.” — [AI XPRIZE](https://ai.xprize.org/AI-For-Good/sustainable-development-goals)

#### My Take

_??_

  

_Each day up until the_ [_AI for Good Summit_](https://www.itu.int/en/ITU-T/AI/2018/Pages/default.aspx) _in Geneva on May 15 I’m writing up a thought on how Artificial Intelligence could impact on each UN Sustainable Development Goal.
