My wife and I love our old Golf, never had any major problems in 17 years, but it’s got to fail sometime… So we’re looking for a new car and with the regular drives to Toronto and elsewhere that living in KW necessitates, we’re hoping to get something with as many of those new fangled autonomous driving features that we can to make that drive more manageable and safe.

Since part of my research is actually on decision making in complex spatiotemporal environments autonomous driving is a natural fit and I have several projects looking at different aspects of it. But as I think more and more about the complexity of a car and driving I’m realizing that we still have many important problems to solve to make cars more fully adaptive to our lifestyles and autonomous. So, as we try out the contenders I thought I’d describe my reaction to each and my thoughts about how much further we really have to go.

## The Contenders

We’ve scoured the Consumer’s Reports on Autonomous Driving and several other blogs and articles (cite). Give our lifestyle and needs we’ve narrowed down the search to the following contenders\* (listed in increasing order of price):

*   Honda Civic Hatchback
*   Hyundai Ionic
*   Acura
*   Audi A3/A4
*   Mercedes
*   Genesis (Hyundai)
*   Tesla

#### Runners Up

*   Subaru — they seem to have similar features to Honda, so not a slam dump in lane keeping and centring and there cars tend to lean large for us. But I know Subaru drivers are proud of their car, and it is solid.
*   Toyota — obviously Toyota is one of the best companies out there with solid quality. But their self driving safety features are not leading right now and given the price point of the Lexus cars with comparable features there was no point considering them once we were looking at Audi vs Mercedes
*   Nissan — on paper the Nissan Rogue satisfies a lot of what we want, it famously has some autonomous drive functions (you remember, that annoying Star Wars : The Force Awakens commercial where the Rey-looking girl who’s scared of traffic gets saved by the force tech of her car.) But it’s a bit big for us and all their smaller cars don’t have as much of these features, so we dropped it early. Great sales experience though.

## \*Open Minds: Limiting your decision space

I has been mentioned to us (by some salespeople and others as we talk about this) that our decision making process is flawed because we are looking at totally different vehicles, like comparing apples and oranges. In particular, a Genesis salesman seemed to balk at the idea that the same people could simultaneously consider a Hyundai and a Genesis, one is utilitarian, affordable and the other is luxury and expensive. I would say that comes from an assumption that money is the primary deciding factor and that luxury features are important. In essence, these people propose we use a very simple **heuristic**, price, to eliminate whole sets of cars from the decision making process. Why limit\*\* your decision space? Also, the auto-industry self-categorizes their offerings for just this purpose, to force you to stay in a category (economy, mid range luxury, luxury) and then they can collectively charge more for chrome trim or whatever.

Money is obviously an important deciding factor, but all these cars are feasible for our budget and offer different benefits. Obviously the Tesla needs to be 3x better at something for it to justify the cost but the important factor for us are the features we want, the service relationship, the car quality. If paying more will satisfy our goals then we pay more. And we couldn’t care less if there’s leather this or chrome that, and the hubcaps, oh my god the choices we have…do people care about it? I could not accurately draw you what the hubcaps on our current 17 year old car look like from memory. I know one has a crack we’ve never fixed, that’s all.

People are fascinating.

### \*\*Closed Minds: We’re using a very simple heuristic too

Having said we don’t like this simple heuristic of price or economy/luxury, we have some irrational simple rules of our own. A major contender for mid-range luxury with autonomous drive isn’t on our list, BMW. I’m they have great tech and a solid car. But we don’t like BMWs as cars or, ok judgement here, the way we see them driving on the road, very aggressive. I know it’s unfair, judgement and based on anecdotal evidence ([although with some support](http://www.wikilender.com/10-cars-most-likely-unreported-accident/)) but we can’t very well go buy one now. It’s alright, lots of other choices out there.

## Audi A3 or A4

We’re a VW house, so Audi feels very natural to us. The salesman told us that all the cars now have Adaptive Cruise Control with Lane Assist and that they even do Stop and Go relative to another car that it has fixed onto ahead of you. This is key for making long drives on the 401 manageable for the windy curves but mostly for the stop and go conditions of traffic jams which never seem to end.

For our preferred adaptive driving features the cars all seem to have the same basics. However, we’ve found out from all the cars we’ve looked at that *"stop and go"* means something like:
1. come to a full stop as the cars stop in front of you
2. then go again automatically without any human interaction *but only* if car is stopped for less than two seconds! 
3. Otherwise, wait until the driver taps the gas or presses the Cruise Control `continue` button. 

I realize there are safety reasons for this, and for stopping at a light or stop sign initiated by the driver this is an essential behaviour, but in that case ACC would have been disabled by hitting the brakes anyways. 

The system can already distinguish between a full stop initiated by the driver and one initiated by the car due to traffic coming to a standstill. 
The situation we are looking at is a traffic jam actually stopping, with cars in front of you, when those cars resume and the driver has still not touched the pedals but has hands on the wheel, then it’s reasonable for the car to resume. 
No car that I am aware of currently does this, except perhaps **Tesla**, they only let us test these features on the highway so we couldn’t see it.


## The Final Decision
We ended up with a Genesis which satisfied most of the requirements we really wanted for autonomous driving for commuting.
