This week the world lost two beautiful people who stood for hope, caring and kindness. These people happened to also be actors who most famously played characters who stood for hope, caring and kindness. I don't it's  a concincidence that good people gravitate to roles about making the world a better place. I wish we all could stand as they did and spread as much joy and hope to the world, because we need it now more than ever.

May they find peace and joy in whatever level of existence their consciousness now inhabits, and may we all keep memories of their positive influence, and never, ever lose hope that the world can be made better.
