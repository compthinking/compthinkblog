## Others' comments
The act is right here:
https://www.parl.ca/DocumentViewer/en/44-1/bill/C-27/first-reading
> It's in 3 parts, regarding consumer privacy protection, personnal data protection, and AI. The AI part doesn't say much that's new, I feel it mostly sets in stone structures to monitor it and lists out punishments for violating it. Mostly it defines what AI is, what **biased results** are, when they are not acceptable, what **harm** (resulting from **biased** outcome) is
> - One interesting point in the data protection section is that it draws a clear distinction between 
> 	- **anonymized** data (data that cannot possibly be traced back to an individual) 
> 	- and **de-identified data** (data for which identifiable information has been removed so that it cannot easily be traced back to an individual but it could be if you put in time and effort),
> - and clearly stated that personal information (information about an identifiable individual) 
> 	- remains personal information after being de-identified 
> 	- but not after being anonymized
> 	- and just overall sets a higher legal protection standard for de-identified data than for anonymized data.

I just got this email:"Good evening Mr.Khoury,
 I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to ask If CAIAC has reviewed the federal government’s bill c-27 that proposes regulations for AI in Canada. CREA’s tech side is know as [realtor.ca](http://realtor.ca/), hence the interest in this bill. I look forward to your feedback.
Best,
Elvanee"Does CAIAC have a position on Bill C-27? I must confess I don't know much about it, and even if I research it it would just be my opinion, no a CAIAC position.

I haven't look3d at it, but I'm always interested in that kind of thing. I think it's fair to say we don't have an opinion on it at this time  We aren't a lobbying organization...should we be? - Mark

Part of CAIAC's mandate is to serve an advisory role to governments. So yes, we should definitely be involved!
