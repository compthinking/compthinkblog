I disagree with [this opinion on computability of human minds](http://www.technologyreview.com/view/511421/the-brain-is-not-computable/), but it’s fascinating research otherwise. He’s showing that new senses can be integrated into mammal brains to produce mice that can see infrared and monkeys that can feel themselves in a fully immersed d computer avatar. I don’t see how people who know how brains, computers and say, complex systems like the internet work can say that it’s impossible, even in theory, to replicate the complexity of the brain in silica. Saying something is not computable is a very strong claim, and a very precise claim. It may be infeasible, but impossible? Proclaiming that the randomness or interconnectivity of the brain can’t be reproduced on a computer severely misunderstands what it going on in computing and AI research these days.
