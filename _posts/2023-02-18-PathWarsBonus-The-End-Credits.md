## Path Wars II : The End Credits


> As I'm teaching a course this term on Algorithms and another on Data Analysis and Machine Learning, I've been using ChatGPT to generate some colourful, alternative explanations for some of the topics of both courses and posting them here. ([Part 1](/Jedi-Master-Dijkstra/), **[Part 2](/PathWarsBonus-The-End-Credits)**, Part 3)

A fun follow-on to my previous post about my first ChatGPT query about [Jedi Master Dijkstra](/Jedi-Master-Dijkstra/). That was fun, and I have some other comments later on the outputs of these Large Language Models (LLMs). But to complete my lecture on Dijkstra's algorithm I injected this generated opening crawl into the lecture. So it seemed fitting the make the end credits as well. They're even more arcanely nerdy, but quite fun if you know enough about planning and graph algorithms. 

[My lecture for Dijkstra's algorithm](https://youtu.be/lkcYfF31vlc) is live now as well and can be seen here.
