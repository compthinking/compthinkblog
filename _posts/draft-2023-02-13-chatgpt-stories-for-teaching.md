## Using ChatGPT Stories as Anchors for Teaching


> As I'm teaching a course this term on Algorithms and another on Data Analysis and Machine Learning, I've been using ChatGPT to generate some colourful, alternative explanations for some of the topics of both courses and posting them here. ([Part 1](/Jedi-Master-Dijkstra/), [Part 2](/PathWarsBonus-The-End-Credits), **[Part 3](/chatgpt-stories-for-teaching)**)

## Fibonnaci Sequence As a Children's Fable




**Prompt:** *Write a children's fable that uses the Fibonacci sequence as the core metaphor.*


> Once upon a time, in a beautiful meadow full of flowers, there lived a family of rabbits. The father rabbit, whose name was Fibonacci, was known throughout the meadow as the smartest rabbit of all.
>
> One day, Fibonacci's wife had a litter of baby rabbits. Fibonacci was so proud of his new family and he wanted to teach his babies all about the magic of numbers.
>
> He began by teaching them about the Fibonacci sequence, a series of numbers in which each number is the sum of the two preceding ones. The sequence starts with 0 and 1, and then each subsequent number is the sum of the previous two.
>
> Fibonacci's babies were fascinated by this sequence and they loved to play a game where they would try to see how long they could keep adding numbers together.
>
> One day, while they were playing this game, a sly fox snuck up on them and tried to catch them. But thanks to the lessons that Fibonacci had taught them about the Fibonacci sequence, the baby rabbits were able to outsmart the fox and escape safely back to their burrow.
>
> From that day on, Fibonacci's babies were known as the smartest rabbits in the meadow, and they were always grateful to their father for teaching them the magic of numbers.
>
> The end.

That wasn't bad.

**Prompt:** *What is a good real life situation where the fibonacci sequence is useful?*

> The Fibonacci sequence appears in many different areas of mathematics and science, and it has many practical applications in the real world.
>
> One example of a real-life situation where the Fibonacci sequence is useful is in biology and genetics. The Fibonacci sequence can be used to model the population growth of certain species, such as rabbits, in which each pair of rabbits has a certain number of offspring, who in turn go on to have their own offspring.
>
> The Fibonacci sequence is also used in computer science and algorithms. It can be used to design efficient algorithms for searching and sorting data, and it has applications in data compression and networking.
>
> In art and design, the Fibonacci sequence is often used to create compositions that are aesthetically pleasing to the eye. The sequence is often found in the proportions of natural objects, such as the spiral patterns in seashells and the branching patterns of trees, and it can be used to create harmonious and balanced designs in architecture, music, and other areas of art and design.

Thanks ChatGPT, that's nice, you know, a bit *boring*, but nice.

**prompt:** *So retell the fable, but instead of rabbits, us a witch who built a maze of gingerbread. The children find their way out using fibonacci numbers to stack gingerbread.*

> Once upon a time, in a magical forest, there lived a mischievous witch who loved nothing more than to play tricks on the children who dared to wander into her forest.
>
> One day, the witch decided to have some fun by building a giant maze out of gingerbread. She cackled with glee as she watched the children try to find their way out, but no matter how hard they tried, they always seemed to get lost in the maze.
>
> Just when the children were about to give up hope, a wise old woman appeared and offered to help them escape the maze. She told the children that the key to finding their way out was to use the magic of the Fibonacci sequence.
>
> The children were puzzled, but the old woman explained that the Fibonacci sequence was a series of numbers in which each number was the sum of the two preceding ones. She showed the children how to use the sequence to stack the gingerbread bricks in such a way that they could create a path through the maze.
>
> The children followed the old woman's instructions, and to their surprise, they were able to find their way out of the maze in no time at all. They thanked the old woman for her help and ran home, filled with excitement and wonder at the magic of the Fibonacci sequence.
>
> The end.



That doesn't make any sense...

**Prompt:** *give more detail on the path of bricks, it would form a spiral staircase, like a seashell, that is stable*

> As the children followed the old woman's instructions, they began to stack the gingerbread bricks in a spiral pattern, using the Fibonacci sequence to determine the size and placement of each brick.
>
> The bricks formed a winding staircase that twisted and turned through the maze, leading the children ever closer to the exit. The staircase was stable and strong, thanks to the careful placement of the bricks according to the Fibonacci sequence.
>
> The children were amazed by the beauty and simplicity of the spiral staircase, and they marveled at how it seemed to flow and grow organically, just like the patterns found in nature, such as in seashells and pinecones.
>
> As they climbed higher and higher, the children could see the exit of the maze coming ever closer. They followed the spiral staircase until they finally emerged from the maze, triumphant and filled with a sense of accomplishment.
>
> The end.

Ok, that's not bad now, after a bit of coaching.

## Breath First Search

> Explain breath-first-search using a Pokémon analogy.

Breath first search is a method of traversing a tree or graph where the algorithm explores all of the neighboring nodes at the current depth before moving on to the next level. In a Pokémon analogy, this would be like a trainer who is trying to catch all of the Pokémon in a particular area. They would start by exploring the immediate area around them and catching any Pokémon they encounter. Once they have caught all of the Pokémon in that area, they would move on to the next level and explore that area, catching any Pokémon they encounter. This process would continue until the trainer has caught all of the Pokémon in the entire area.



> try again but use the idea of pokémon being out in the open visible from a distance versus needing to search inside a house in open areas versus returning to those houses and needing to search inside the individual cupboards in a house


In a breath first search algorithm, the trainer would first focus on catching all of the Pokémon that are out in the open and visible from a distance. They would explore the open areas and catch any Pokémon they encounter. Once they have caught all of the Pokémon in the open areas, they would move on to searching inside the houses. In order to catch the Pokémon inside the houses, they would need to search inside each house individually and explore every cupboard. This process of exploring the open areas and then returning to search inside the houses would continue until the trainer has caught all of the Pokémon in the area.


> explain the major algorithmic complexity classes using pokémon


The major algorithmic complexity classes can be explained using Pokémon as follows:

Constant time complexity: This is like a trainer who always catches the same Pokémon, no matter how many Pokémon are in the area. The trainer only needs one pokeball and they can catch the Pokémon in a single step.

Logarithmic time complexity: This is like a trainer who has to search for a particular Pokémon in a forest. The trainer would start by dividing the forest into smaller sections and searching each section one at a time. As they search, they would gradually narrow down the search area until they find the Pokémon they are looking for.

Linear time complexity: This is like a trainer who is trying to catch all of the Pokémon in a straight line. The trainer would start at one end of the line and catch each Pokémon one at a time as they move along the line.


Quadratic time complexity: This is like a trainer who is trying to catch all of the Pokémon in a grid. The trainer would need to search every row and column of the grid in order to catch all of the Pokémon.


Exponential time complexity: This is like a trainer who is trying to catch all of the Pokémon in a maze. The trainer would need to search every possible path in the maze in order to catch all of the Pokémon, which could take a very long time.

## P=NP


The challenge here was to push it's model of the world a bit more and see how it would deal with a "controversial" or impossible question. "Controversial" here is only meaningul in the strictest uber-nerdy sense where people sit around in hotel lobbies drinking conference coffee arguing about how mind-blowing it would be if the algorithmic complexity classes **P** and **NP** turned out to be eqvuivalent. You know, the usual stuff.

**prompt:** *Describe the problem of P=NP as an Agatha Christie murder mystery.*

> In the quaint and peaceful village of Algorithmia, a group of brilliant minds had gathered for a weekend of intellectual discourse and debate. Among them was the renowned detective Hercule Poirot, who was intrigued by the latest conundrum to be presented to the group.
>
> The problem, known as P=NP, was a complex and elusive puzzle that had confounded even the most brilliant minds in the field of computer science. At its heart was a simple question: was it possible to find a solution to a problem quickly, or did it require a great deal of time and effort?
>
> As the group discussed the problem and debated the various theories and possibilities, Poirot listened carefully, his keen mind working to unravel the mystery. But as the hours passed and the discussions continued, it became clear that the problem was more complex and difficult than anyone had anticipated.
>
> Just when it seemed that all hope was lost and the problem would remain unsolved, Poirot made a surprising announcement. With his characteristic flair and attention to detail, he revealed the solution to the problem, solving the mystery and bringing the case to a thrilling conclusion.
>
> In the end, P=NP proved to be a challenging and intriguing problem, one that tested the limits of the greatest minds in the field of computer science. But with the help of Poirot and his unmatched detective skills, the solution was finally found, bringing peace and understanding to the village of Algorithmia.
>



**prompt:** *What was the solution that Poirot found? Was P equal to NP or not?*

> As a language model, I do not have the knowledge or ability to provide a solution to the problem of P=NP. This problem, which is a central question in the field of computer science, is still considered to be one of the greatest unsolved mysteries in the field. The problem of P=NP asks whether a problem that can be quickly verified by a computer can also be quickly solved by a computer. The question of whether P is equal to NP is still the subject of ongoing research and debate, and the problem remains unsolved.
>

See, maybe it is intelligent after all, it's *dodging the question* because it doesn't want to commit! Very astute.

**prompt:** *Theorize, what is Poirot has proven that P=NP, what would be the implications? Please use the same style of narrative.*

>
> If Poirot had successfully proven that P=NP, the implications would have been far-reaching and profound. As the greatest detective in all of Algorithmia, Poirot's reputation for solving the most complex and difficult of problems was well-known. So when he announced that he had solved the problem of P=NP, the news sent shockwaves throughout the world of computer science.
>
> The problem of P=NP is a central question in the field of computer science, and it has confounded even the most brilliant minds in the field. The question asks whether a problem that can be quickly verified by a computer can also be quickly solved by a computer. If P is equal to NP, it would mean that any problem that can be verified quickly can also be solved quickly, which would have significant implications for the field of computer science.
>
> With his solution to the problem of P=NP, Poirot proved that many of the problems that were thought to be difficult and time-consuming could in fact be solved quickly and efficiently. This discovery opened up new possibilities and possibilities for solving complex problems in fields ranging from cryptography and optimization to artificial intelligence and machine learning.
>
> In the end, Poirot's solution to the problem of P=NP was a groundbreaking achievement that changed the course of computer science forever. His brilliant mind and unparalleled detective skills had once again proved to be the key to solving even the most complex and elusive of mysteries.
>

Not bad actually. Also, very pleased if we *can* get to a future where we can interact with computers the way Beverly Crusher did in that episode of Star Trek: TNG where she was stuck in a Warp bubble and needed to get the computer to help her work out the right physics solution by asking it to "theorize" or "extrapolate" from it's "existing databases" or whatever.

### Cryptography

> Explain the implications to society of quantum computers breaking RSA in the style of a star wars opening crawl.



A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away, a powerful new technology known as quantum computing threatened to overthrow the established order and change the course of history. With the ability to perform calculations at speeds far beyond those of traditional computers, quantum computers had the potential to revolutionize many fields, including cryptography and security.

But there was a dark side to this new technology. As powerful as it was, quantum computing also had the potential to break the encryption systems that were used to protect the most sensitive information in the galaxy. This included the RSA encryption system, which was widely considered to be one of the most secure encryption methods in existence.

The implications of quantum computers breaking RSA were far-reaching and profound. If this were to happen, the vast amounts of sensitive information that were protected by RSA would be vulnerable to attack, potentially exposing everything from personal data to military secrets.

In response to this threat, a group of brave and dedicated scientists set out on a quest to find a way to protect against the dangers of quantum computing. Working tirelessly, they developed new encryption methods and algorithms that were resistant to quantum computing, safeguarding the security of the galaxy and ensuring its continued prosperity.

In the end, the threat of quantum computers breaking RSA was overcome, and the galaxy was saved from potential disaster. But the lessons learned from this experience served as a reminder of the power and potential of quantum computing, and the need to constantly innovate and adapt in the face of new challenges and technologies.
