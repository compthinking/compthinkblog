Fascinating study out of the University of Trento on using Machine Vision algorithms to learn how people respond emotionally to abstract art.

Abstract art might be easier to replicate automatically since you don’t need to worry about as much symbolism as much. But is this going to put artists out of a job? Well no, people create art because they want to, or need to, and if computers don’t have anything to say what they produce may look like art but surely it won’t be as compelling. But if computers can generate abstract patterns and images that are emotionally evocative on demand then that could hurt artists who rely on selling their images or the rights to reproduce them in other media.  
  
So, just something for artists to be aware of.
