[The Consequences of Machine Intelligence — Moshe Y. Vardi — The Atlantic](http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2012/10/the-consequences-of-machine-intelligence/264066/ "The Consequences of Machine Intelligence - Moshe Y. Vardi - The Atlantic")  
I just started reading this, but it’s right along the lines of what I’m talking about with people being aware of how advancing technology could affect their career plans. I’ll read it and write more later. Do you have any thoughts on it? It would be an interesting group discussion topic here or on G+.
