#### My Take

One fascinating challenge is a side affect of the increasing popularity of electric vehicles. If the power grid can flow both ways, then electric cars represent a huge, mobile electric batteries which can be treated as a resource in the system. If neighbourhood demand increases slightly them obtaining that power from unused vehicles does many problems. As an optimization problem this is challenging. But now imagine predicting per user power usage and driving needs based on all the factors which influence human decision making.

Another great AI problem I’ve seen people working on is better analysis and prediction of local wind patterns to optimize load and angle parameters of massive wind turbines.

This whole goal, as well as some others, are essentially the focus of the field of [**Computational Sustainability**](http://www.computational-sustainability.org)**.**

_Each day up until the_ [_AI for Good Summit_](https://www.itu.int/en/ITU-T/AI/2018/Pages/default.aspx) _in Geneva on May 15 I’m writing up a thought on how Artificial Intelligence could impact on each UN Sustainable Development Goal.
