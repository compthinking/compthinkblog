The Future of Life Institute has released a new call for a [ban on Lethal Autonomous Weapons](https://futureoflife.org/lethal-autonomous-weapons-pledge/?submitted=1#confirmation). Here is the response I attached after I signed it:

People often express fears about the impacts of Artificial Intelligence on society which extrapolate from a few facts to unrealistic futures. However, two major impacts of AI on the global well-being of humanity are very real indeed. One is the impact of AI will have on employment given the current structure of western economies. The second is the use of AI for automating humanities penchant for killing and war. This has already begun and the technology to fully automate many aspects of war are already available and could be devastating if implemented fully. Thus, the only hope is to create complete, unmistakable resistance to any further automation of the ability to kill other human beings. Like the bans on chemical and nuclear weapons this will not necessarily stop autonomous weapons from ever being developed but it will slow them significantly and provide an essential framework for punishing those who try.
