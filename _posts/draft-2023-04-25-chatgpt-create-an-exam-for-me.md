## Using ChatGPT Stories as Anchors for Teaching


> As I'm teaching a course this term on Algorithms and another on Data Analysis and Machine Learning, I've been using ChatGPT to generate some colourful, alternative explanations for some of the topics of both courses and posting them here. ([Part 1](/Jedi-Master-Dijkstra/), [Part 2](2023-02-18-PathWarsBonus-The-End-Credits.md), **[Part 3](/chatgpt-stories-for-teaching)**)



## TODO: opening
- it wasn't very good at it
- lots of bad questions, useless questions, wrong answers
- but a few were good enough
- so I tried it out
- but I've spoken to my students about using GPT for assignments, it's not allowed, so I need to be ethical here
- I told them the prompts I used, I told them how many quetisons there would be
- I even told them how badly the process went, to discourage them from using it to study

table of questions, answered correctly vs false , compared to my own questions

| Question Writer | Average Score | Median Score | Std of Score | 
| --- | --- | --- | --- | 
| Prof | 75.4% | ? | ? |
| Chat-GPT | ? | ? | ?|

- show distribution of guessing (a perfect gaussian curve?)
- Now a fun bonus question would be, can you guess who wrote the questions?
	- it turns out you can, a few students got prefct and told me how they did it
	- *inconsistency*
	- Someone did guess right for a good reason, explain it
