## Toronto
Toronto, Canada will not get a total solar eclipse, only an *Annular Solar Eclipse*. This means the will be partially covered by the moon, but never entirely blocked. If you look at the sun through your special solar viewing glasses, it will look like a cookie monster has taken a big bite out of the sun! Since the sun will be still visible, the glasses  **ALWAYS NEEDS TO USE** to view the eclipse directly in Toronto. But also take a look at making your own ***Pin-hole Camera!***

# Questions About the Eclipse

## So, will *you* be able to see the eclipse?

This google map from Xavier Jubier lets you check different total solar eclipses against a precise location:

## Viewing the Eclipse
Everyone knows that you shouldn't look at the sun directly for more than a second. But during a total solar eclipse there is a few minutes where you really can look at the sun, because the Moon is covering it completely!

When the eclipse comes, you'll need your solar eclipse glasses to let you watch until that moment arrives, and to leave you watch the sun return after the eclipse is over!

Here is some information about safe viewing of solar eclipses to go with your glasses.

### Safety Page from the American Astronomical Society
See this page for lots of useful information about how to view the eclipse safely.

- **If you are in Toronto** or anywhere else that is **not on the path of totality**, then you can make a pinhole camera instead:
