My name is Mark Crowley.
This is my blog about the world from a computational point of view, which is *in a way*, the only point of view there is.

Different versions of me you may be looking for:
- Academic: 
  - my [AI/ML Research Lab](https://uwaterloo.ca/scholar/mcrowley) as an Assistant Professor at the [University of Waterloo](https://uwaterloo.ca/electrical-computer-engineering/about/people/mcrowley)
  - [Google Scholar](http://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=eL_y80EAAAAJ)
  - [LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/in/markanthonycrowley)
- Politics: I have opinions, mostly on democratic systems and Canadian politics. Find them at [PopTheStack](http://popthestack.wordpress.com/)
