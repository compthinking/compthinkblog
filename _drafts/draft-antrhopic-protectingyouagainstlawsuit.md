Well this is an interesting way to deal with it...

In December Anthropic [updated their terms of service](https://www.anthropic.com/news/expanded-legal-protections-api-improvements) with the following tidbits:

> We are introducing new, simplified Commercial Terms of Service with an expanded copyright indemnity, as well as an improved developer experience with our beta Messages API. Customers will now enjoy increased protection and peace of mind as they build with Claude, as well as a more streamlined API that is easier to use.


> Our Commercial Terms of Service (previously our services agreement) will enable our customers to retain ownership rights over any outputs they generate through their use of our services and protect them from copyright infringement claims. Under the updated terms, we will defend our customers from any copyright infringement claim made against them for their authorized use of our services or their outputs, and we will pay for any approved settlements or judgments that result. These new terms will be live on January 1, 2024 for Claude API customers and January 2, 2024Â for those using Claude through Amazon Bedrock.
