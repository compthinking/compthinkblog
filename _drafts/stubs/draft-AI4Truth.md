With all the excitement recently in advances in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning (AI/ML), especially **Generative AI** models such as OpenAI's GPT, there is a huge need for addressing a broader notion of AI that will be needed for use in the real world. Most of these methods can interpolate, predict, generate new patterns from data but they do this by learning *correlations* between features in the data, and datapoints over time. But there is a huge literature with methods and theory that deal with other kinds of relationships we can use to describe data, such as *causality* {% cite bagi2023icml %}, *uncertainty*, *confidence*, and *truth*.

### Thoughts to add
- we cannot cede the word "Truth" to conspiracy theorists
